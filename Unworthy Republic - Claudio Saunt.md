1820-30 isaac mccoy

- unique individual with self-claimed authority
- felt the call to "save the indians" in and around indiana and michigan.
- claimed native people were "the very filth of civilized society"
- kept journals of drunken violence and senseless murder from his missionary outpost
- envisioned "aboriginia" â€” an indigenous nation provided by the united states, a place where indigenous people would be united together, worship god, smoke peace pipes, et al.
- this sort of concept was proposed by many other people around that time (including thomas jefferson)
- the thought was that the exchange of lands would protect native peoples until thet were assimilated into the us population
- andrew jackson negotiated one of these treaties with the cherokees in 1817

native perspective / looming expulsion

- most native american peoples at this point had been living alongside colonizing white people for serveral generations and believed the way things were was maintainable.
- they were being tol that they could not survive much longer this way and must abandon their lands
- between 1800 and 1830, native people surrendered territory totaling 140k square miles (size of ohio, indiana, and illinois combined) while us population went from 50k to 1.5m
- northern native peoples had started developing considerably prosperous communities in the northern midwest and did not believe the promised "indian territories" offered in exchange for their lands was all it was being cracked up to be.
- many colonizers recognized how thriving these communities were and even offered that it would be "a cruelty" to expel these communities.
- many whites did not want them to leave and many nantive peoples wanted to stay and work alongside those people. there was shared community taking place.
- many us citizens were forced to reckon with this, and had to clear their conciences with these being "laws of nature" rather than "choice"
- there was still a lot of poverty in these areas amongst native communities.
- us southeast also had hesitant nations unwilling to leave, similar story there.
- bonds were forming between us citizens and native peoples, the only thing irreconcilable was native and white ownership of the same land.

us political reasoning

- the belief was that 1. native peoples were rapidly declining and needed saving, and 2. western territory would provide for these peoples who would die in the east. neither point was well founded.
- this allowed us citizens to feel charitable and righteous about colonizing / dispossessing native peoples.
- decline was seen as "law of nature" to thomas jefferson. and "a pity" and a scandal to let it take place. "imminent extinction" became accepted as fact since it was talked about so frequently.
- it was blamed on native women going to war instead of having babies, alcohol, it being "inherent in nature"
- in reality, disease, war, and out-migration. population halved between 1600-1700, and by another third between 1700-1800
- some even proposed to save indigenous amercans by enslaving them ("benevolent curse")
- those that insisted indigenous populations were on the decline (to the objection of those populations), were also convinced that the american west could help save them ("aboriginia").
- deportation would free up the land for white laborers (thomas jefferson)
- john elliott of georgia (1825): the enslavement of african peoples was used to justify that the correct natural order for people of different skin colors was to "unfortunately" be in a dynamic that "subsists together"
- this was seen as "somber" but practical and based on "real life" / the way things just are. this was believed to improve the conditions for both parties, and was used to argue a similar dynamic should be applied for colonizer relationships with the native nations ("mutual dependence")
- disposition and enslavement were acts of humanity.

outcomes

- as they learned more, it became clear the promise of the west wasnt what us colinizers thought it was.
- pivot to instructing native peoples how to "live right"
- teaching english, the bible, give up hunting, start farming, producing clothing, etc. abandon autonomy for us culture
- native peoples knew that without education they could not compete with encroaching colonizing us
- "civilizing plan" was ethnocentric and self-serving and frequently paternalistic and cynical. erasure.
- this plan by most accounts was surprisingly successful (1820s), even segregationists (john calhoun) recognized that it was working to keep indigenous people in their place.
- in order to justify state-sponsored explulsion, this was going to need to be perceived as approaching impending doom, and inevitable catastrophe.
- people were aware of historical perceptions of mass expulsion, and would have to be perceived as a "philanthropic enterprise" that was a matter of "justice and moderation"
- by late 1820s the tide had shifted to one in which mass expulsion felt necessary and practical in dc. how did this happen?

### Chapter 2: The White People of Georgia

_2021-09-06_

"socrates" 1825-1830

- people wrote opinion pieces with greek and roman philosopher names
- "socrates" was one of these wrote an 8000 word essay in a georgian journal
- made the case that "barbarous and savage" native creek nation in alabama's land would be best "rescued from a state of wilderness"
- that this would be "philanthropic and just"
- since "indian title" was considered to be "mere custom" it had no significance
- georgian land was "valuable" and could "grow cotton" georgian senator john elliott
- georgia was seen as an opportunity to assert itself some independence from the north.
- outside florida, georgia was the largest state in the union
- socrates made the case that were natives to be naturalized, then the enslaved would eventually be as well. this was perceived as a threat
- socrates was a racist, interpretting "we the people" explicitly as "we the white people" and made many appeals that that be preserved
- anyone making a case for the rights of these peoples was seen as the north trying to limit the south economically
- "northerners were not motivated by benevolence but jealousy"
- socrates basically threatened war against the north if georgia was not supported in deporting native nations

us govt

- there was a law passed by congress and signed by jefferson at the heart of the successful state-sponsored systematic explusion of indigenous families
- 1830 georgia had lots of land without people to take care of it. taking more land from indigenous people was seen as unnecessary and even bad for the land itself (georgia last of 13 original states to still have significant indigenous population)
- george troup 1820s "mad governer of georgia" joined with princeton classmates john forsyth and john berrien to eliminate native peoples from the eastern half of the us
- troup specifically targeted creek and cherokee nations trying to expel them from georgia
- troup saw georgia land as white mans birthright and that civilizing native peoples as a "great scheme" to keep native peoples on the land
- william mcintosh, part british part creek, was well connected in both worlds but often exploited his creek connections politically. single handedly ceded creek territories and accepted bribes from us commissioners ("treaty of indian springs"). was executed by creek nation april 1825, house surrounded by 150 armed men, set afire and he was shot dead.
- georgia white male voting citizens shared guilt by voting for troup for his achievements in dispossessing the creek nation in georgia
- troup was seen as a defender of "georgian rights" for "native" georgians (white colonizers)
- georgian land was seen as belonging to "native" white georgians.
- 1826 treaty of washington, creeks agreed to have georgian lands ceded, but only if guaranteed their remaining territory.
- choctaws, chickasaws, cherokees, creeks all pushed back against ceding land
- southern politicians sought to devise "other means" by which to expel native nations 1826-27. john mckinley of alabama, thomas buck of mississippi, thomas w cobb of georgia were the subcommittee that developed a strategy central in the national campaign to deport indigenous americans
- it was deemed "extremely improbable" that "negotiation and treaty" would effectively drive native families out of the southern states. needed "lawful and practical means" to accomplish it
- the plan was to extend state laws to indigenous peoples, treating them as members of the states with limited rights, assign them small plots to them. the result being that they will either leave for the. west or be incorporated into colonized body. the latter not really being seen as a possibility.
- that latter possibility was seen as a terrifying thing even if implausible and this was seen as a daring proposition
- this strategy was made largely in secret

logistics of westward expulsion

- water was quicker and cheaper transport at that time
- 60k southern native peoples, 80k total needed migration
- since this would be seen as a "humanitarian undertaking," 15% mortality rate of the middle passage (enslaved peoples) would not be tolerated
- interstate slavetrade model was not seen as viable as it was more like 2k per year, not 60k at one time
- refered to as "migration" instead of what it was "trafficking"

northern perception

- these efforts were largly made fun of by north instead of worked in opposition against
- white southerners called northern critics hypocrites as they had already "exterminated" native peoples
- humanitarian efforts were perceived as "whining charity" and "sentimental trash"
- not all those opposing southern expulsion in the north were the stereotype though. native peoples put forward leaders who argued and made appeals to congress for the protection of the rights of indigenous nations
- the south needed federal aid to actually achieve this expulsion with northern and native resistance
- isaac mccoy had epiphany in 1823 about "aboriginia" and slaveholder andrew jackson became president in 1828. jackson had a history as a general slaughtering native peoples as a southern war hero
- 97 percent of georgia voters voted for jackson.
- december 1829, jackson called for "voluntary" emoigration of native peoples to lands west of the mississippi

## Section Two: The View from Washington City

### Chapter 3: The Debate

_2021-09-07_

the cherokee phoenix - 1828

- published in northern georgia (chrokee capital new echota)
- many english newspapers (1 per 10k people)
- sequoyah, a chrokee polymath from little tennessee valley invented a written chrokee script
- within a few years of inventing the script, 90% of chrokee nation was literate.
- december 1829 cherokee phoenix published the "memorial of the cherokees" to the us congress
- it asked for pity, sought to dispute the claim that chrokees were "tenants at will" in georgia
- the cherokee and english translations were precisely worded differently per audience, aiming to appeal to both audiences
- roughly 3k out of 18k chrokee signed this petition, most in chrokee syllabary
- chrokee helped creek nation to draft their own
- speaker of the house dismissed both without discussion
- the cherokee memorial was distributed across newspapers and rallied northern sentiments
- this production was seen as a direct challenge to the idea of native nations savagery and subhumanity
- so much so that sequoyah was even said to have caucasian blood in an effort to combat the work
- the cherokee phoeniz defied white southerners who thought all "persons of color" be denied the ability to speak for themselves
- there was a scramble of sorts throughout the 1820s to prevent native nations from speaking for themselves, as well as an effort from native peoples to do so (cherokee scholar david brown)
- by the time the first bill "for the exchange of lands" was introduced into congress in january 1830, native peoples had already cultivated a fervent opposition

jackson, everts, womens petitions

- within weeks of the inauguration, jackson administration started working on principle legislation
- jeremiah everts, converted by native american activists into a native peoples rights activist and writer, wrote 24 essays in late 1829 laying out case against expulsion as argued by native americans all the years prior
- everts followed the lead of indigenous activists, but to a larger audience. was read in at least 40 newspapers and read by a half million people (population of 13 million)
- thanks to this, petitions flooded congress, most formed in evangelical language of the day, were also arguably radical as well
- expulsion was seen as unjust and rarely seen amongst civilized nations
- many womens petition drives came out for the cause, which hadnt been formerly seen. this was used by southern powers as evidence that the north was becoming effeminate, soft, and the gendered criticism was accepted by many in power (men), even in the north.

jackson's early presidency

- inauguration coincided with gold being found in august 1829 which led thousands to min native lands, this led to increased violence in native communities
- expulsion debate started april 6 1830
- lots of back and forth arguing that sounds quite familiar to modern day righteous indignance.
- "to save" native peoples, "they must be expelled."
- counter argument was stronger, that treaties were treaties, regardless of anything else
- the argument was basically "leave, and save yourself"
- expansion of slavery in southern states was also at the root of a lot of this
- under threat from jackson administration as well as vote bargaining, a few house members switched sides and cast votes to expel 102 to 97
  public spirit and outrage was not enough and waned

the "act to provide and exchange of lands with the indians residing in any of the states or territories, and fro their removal west of the river mississippi"

- was poorly put together
- deported families received aid for one year after expulsion
- was explicitly outlined in writing that "this does not violate a treaty"
- no way to tell value of land, no method for negotiation, the logistics of transportation were excluded, no supervision stated
- warnings became threats and by mid 1830s troops were force marching people in chains in alabama and pursuing starving families from camp to camp in florida
- whole thing crumbled and became a nightmare

### Chapter 4: "Forked Tongue and Shallow Heart"

_2021-09-12_

expulsion

- jackson admin churned through anyone who expressed doubt or question policy
- over half of the staff in the bureau of indian affairs was replaced (29) in the first few years of jackson presidency.
- result was administration with several zealous officers at the top with little sympathy for indigenous americans, and dozens of inexperienced, appointees at the bottom
- 1828 georgia legislature "possesed the right" to extend its laws to the chrokee nation and to "coerce obedience." in 1829 they passed a law that would nullify cherokee laws and customers starting june 1830
- december 1830 state forbade cherokee from meeting in council or any judicial body. alabama and mississippi also passed similarly opppressive laws iaround the same time
- native response to expulsion act was to not cooperate. cherokee nation started to prepare a lawsuit
- jackson had wanted to meet with creek, cherokee, choctaw, and chickasaw leaders. only a few choctaw came and the chickasaws did attend, but regretted it
- "negotiations" took place, jackson delivered a speech then got out.
- chickasaws expressed a desire to see the lands they would be given before agreeing to anything. they were told if you dont agree you wont get anything.
- reluctantly and under extreme pressure, the chickasaws "agreed" to their own expulsion
- jackson reemerges to talk about how they will all be taken care of and to celebrate this new "friendship" and so on. in private, he wrote future president james polk, "i have in the chickisaw treaty destroyed the serpent."
- similar approach was taken by u.s. in the following negotiations with choctaws. choctaw leader george harkins compared situation to a man surrounded on three sides by a raging fire with water and a distant shore on the fourth. "who would call plunging into the water a voluntary act?" expulsion was mandated.
- john eaton and john coffee claimed to choctaws, "it is not your lands, but your happiness that we seek to obtain."
- anonymous deportee wrote "the new jaw bone" lyrics hating on john eaton
- choctaws too, fearing extermination, signed a treaty of their own expulsion
- through the 1830s, nations in ohio were expelled, whites wanted to open up trade through great lakes

legislative oppression

- native and african americans were prohibited in georgia and alabama from testifying against white people.
- reasons given to justify this was that native peoples did not believe in eternal punishment and therefore could not be counted on to tell the truth
- all people being given an equally weighted voice was a threat, and the fear of this was documented
- 1822 mississippi law required every "free negro or mulatto" between ages 16 and 50 to quit the state within ninety days or be solid into slavery for five years
- 1832 alambama law prohibted all free persons of color from settling in the state on penalty of whipping and if not leaving within 20 days, enslavement for one year
- in georgia free "people of color" who entered the state were bound as laborers until the could pay a fine of $100, cosigning most to a life of servitude
- 1828 georgia law proihibited creek people from crossing into the. state without a permit, ten day prison sentence was penalty
- language was also used to keep native peoples under the thumb of the law. laws spanning hundreds of books were only seen as a mode of oppression to native peoples, not something they could leverage for their own protection
- the response to these voices was always "it's bad, but unfortunately nothing can be done"
- the execution of george tassel. us supreme court case "the cherokee nation v the state of georgia" sets precedent that indigenous nations are "domestic dependent nations" not "foreign states" and therefore supreme court has no jurisdiction as outlined in the consitution. this has defined legal relations between u.s. and indigenous nations ever since.
- were the supreme court to have jurisdiction, it would have likely ruled in favor of the cherokee nation

war department

- war department "indian office" was a "monument to the people it made disappear" with paintings and artifacts decorating the room where expulsion was poorly planned
- imprecise surveyors' reports, fabricated maps from trader and traveler reports, it was hard to have an accurate picture of the west without years of research. "we have no satisfactory information"
- land was promised to chrokees, but then promised again later to chickasaw nation. to solve it, osage land could be given to cherokees displacing osage, or choctaw land given to chickasaw, displacing choctaw. a total disorganized mess.
- a "grand river of the neosho" was referred to in u.s.-cherokee treaty of 1828, but it didnt even exist. it was a tiny creek and no one could find it.
- maps were made inaccurately, reducing territories by 13 percent accidentally miscalculating distances and basic units of measurement
- reports of early migrants to the west were not encouraging. "it is a graveyard"
- 60 of 455 quapaws had starved to death in 1827
- 1830 treaty was conditional on chickasaws finding a suitable location in the west. john coffee negotiated a second expulsion treaty in 1832 without that condition, the treaty of pontotoc.
- levi colbert wrote a 14 page letter of protest to jackson. 61 chickasaw men signed the letter objecting to coffee's attempts at bribary. "i had not lived and cast my senses, as you know, along the whiteman's march, with my eyes shut. i saw the white man's march was to take my country. i prepared my mind and the mind of my nation for it." Was "the spirit of liberality and equality which distinguishes the united states from all the empires merely a healousy and defence of their own particular rights, an unwillingness to be oppressed themselves?" or was it "a high respect for the rights of others, an unwillingness, that any man high or low should be wronged?"
- "I want my father, to keep down the tomhawk in the Chickasaw hands for ever. Will my father listen. My Chiefs and warriors heard the Presidents talks which he made to us at Franklin in the house of God. Remember my Father, the true and living fire, which caught in your breast, flowed in your eyes, and imparted a heavenly flame into all our bosoms, -- can my Nation now, in the midst of its difficulties, look to this President and the Constitution which rules him, for a protecting guardian. Can the injured in their weakness, find in this man a never failing friend. A broad field my father is presented, it is the cause of justice, humanity and weakness. It is not the voice of restive man which ought to a wake the sensibilities of the President and Senate, but the cry of a Naked Nation contending with one man for their National rights, will arise those authorities to defend the powerless, and show to the world, that -- that spirit of liberity and equality, which distinquishes the United States from all the Empires in the world, is not as many might imagine, a jealously and defense of their own particular rights, an unwillingness to be oppressed themselves but a high respect for the rights of Others, -- an unwillingness, that any man high or low should be wronged." [Levi Colbert to President Andrew Jackson, 22 NOV 1832](https://web.archive.org/web/20111025065425/http://www.chickasawhistory.com/CHICL_32.htm)

expulsion begins

- preparing for expulsion of choctaw nation. 15-20k people from mississippi
- george gibson put in charge by jackson
- they had confidence, but already nearly a hundred choctaw wqomen and children were starving in the west indian territory.
- choctaw weren't going to go easily

## Section Three: The Best Laid Plans

### Chapter 5: The Plan of Operations

_2021-11-25_

george gibson

- in the first 50 years of us, 174 delegations fro mat least 55 different indigenous nations traveled to meet with the us president and congress
- george gibson commissary general of subsistence sought to administer and settle all the accounts and claims of indigenous peoples after their deportation
- his office was initially created to provision the army more effectively
- the paperwork was astronomical
- admonished "unnecessary" expenditures like medical care which at time was life or death for natives
- gibson's office was highly regulatory and prioritized rule creation and rule following
- absurdly regulated, down to how paper was to be folded for roll taking
- this guy and his rules were governing the deportation. officers instructed not to feed deportees ponies, give them coffee, etc
- every expense was personally scrutinized by his office
- best use of "public funds" was seen as the ethical motive in expulsion instead of the humanity of the expelled

choctaw expulsion

- was the first under legislation of may 1830, was the test case for future operations
- federal agent william ward in charge was often too drunk to read or write and sometimes had his servant open mail for him. described as confused and impaired
- ward actively worked to deter choctaws who wanted to stay according to treaty rules and had every right legally to stay
- ward was supposed to write down names of those who wanted to stay in mississippi, and simply didnt until everyone eventually agreed to expulsion
- steamboats were particularly dangerous from explosions and disease. groups did not want to board for fear of death
- senecas and delawares of sandusky ohio 8 month journey to ne oklahoma. at least 30 died, and 14 left sick out of 398 in the journey.
- treaty for a different tribe of senecas was forwarded to officers confusing everyone, showing the type of confusion that was constant and indicating how poorly managed the operation was.
- failure blamed on the natives. "they seem to think they have nothing to do except wait to be moved by the government", they departed too late, should have taken water transportation, etc
- natives seen as people that simply didnt want to do what they were being asked to do

### Chapter 6: The Cholera Times

_2021-11-26_

lewis cass milatary operations against the sauk, meskwaki / fox, and ho-chunk / winnebago

- in addition to the three sisters (corn, beans, and squash), mining was a part of these tribes' history. lead sulfide / galena had religious and pigmentation purposes.
- colonists swarmed during the lead rush, and built lodging that paled in comparison to the sauk landowners who lived there
- it didnt take long for the colonizers to start taking these houses away from sauk owners
- after three years of this, sauks abandoned their villages and crossed the mississippi
- about one year later, 1000 sauks returned and had a tense standoff over their land
- commander edmond gaines, who had been outspoken against jackson's policies was recovering from sickness in tennessee, so the jackson admin passed over him and gave command to general henry atkinson to drive the sauk and fox over the mississippi
- a company of drunken illinois rangers attacked the sauks and were routed despite having the numbers. this was called the black hawk war, named after the sauk leader
- an example was sought to be made of the sauks in northern illinois
- 2300+ including a young abraham lincoln pursued the sauks without success for a month.
- jackson was continually embarassed by these failures and his rage increased

cholera and sauk defeat - 1832

- throughout chicagoland and the upper midwest, cholera decimated colonist solidiers
- bodies were thrown into rivers and lake michigan
- atkinson managed to defeat the sauks during this time in a battle
- soldiers pursued the survivors, capturing and brutalizing them. the largest group of survivors was pinned and over 260 were killed with around 200 escaping over the river
- ho-chunks, menominee, dakotas, and potawatomis, trying to build favor with the united states, hunted down surviving villagers and their starving children
- the federal government claimed the sauk people ceded their eastern lands and therefore were not owed an exchange of lands
- free sauk prisoners carried cholera into their communities in the west. how many died is unknown
- cholera and malaria killed many in the summer of 1833
- by one estimate 20 percent of choctaws in the west died by fall 1833, creeks in the west died at a similar rate
- not more than 1/4 of creek children born between 1830 and 1833 were still alive after the arkansas river flood of june 1833

perception in the east

- americans believed native people were leaving voluntarily
- in the east the perception was still that the united states was on a humanitarian mission to save and preserve native peoples
- many believed the sauk war was justifiable based on sauk vulgarity
- cherokee john ross fought a legal war against the united states during this time
- worcester v georgia 1831-33
