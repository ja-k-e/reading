1820-30 isaac mccoy

- unique individual with self-claimed authority
- felt the call to "save the indians" in and around indiana and michigan.
- claimed native people were "the very filth of civilized society"
- kept journals of drunken violence and senseless murder from his missionary outpost
- envisioned "aboriginia" â€” an indigenous nation provided by the united states, a place where indigenous people would be united together, worship god, smoke peace pipes, et al.
- this sort of concept was proposed by many other people around that time (including thomas jefferson)
- the thought was that the exchange of lands would protect native peoples until thet were assimilated into the us population
- andrew jackson negotiated one of these treaties with the cherokees in 1817

native perspective / looming expulsion

- most native american peoples at this point had been living alongside colonizing white people for serveral generations and believed the way things were was maintainable.
- they were being tol that they could not survive much longer this way and must abandon their lands
- between 1800 and 1830, native people surrendered territory totaling 140k square miles (size of ohio, indiana, and illinois combined) while us population went from 50k to 1.5m
- northern native peoples had started developing considerably prosperous communities in the northern midwest and did not believe the promised "indian territories" offered in exchange for their lands was all it was being cracked up to be.
- many colonizers recognized how thriving these communities were and even offered that it would be "a cruelty" to expel these communities.
- many whites did not want them to leave and many nantive peoples wanted to stay and work alongside those people. there was shared community taking place.
- many us citizens were forced to reckon with this, and had to clear their conciences with these being "laws of nature" rather than "choice"
- there was still a lot of poverty in these areas amongst native communities.
- us southeast also had hesitant nations unwilling to leave, similar story there.
- bonds were forming between us citizens and native peoples, the only thing irreconcilable was native and white ownership of the same land.

us political reasoning

- the belief was that 1. native peoples were rapidly declining and needed saving, and 2. western territory would provide for these peoples who would die in the east. neither point was well founded.
- this allowed us citizens to feel charitable and righteous about colonizing / dispossessing native peoples.
- decline was seen as "law of nature" to thomas jefferson. and "a pity" and a scandal to let it take place. "imminent extinction" became accepted as fact since it was talked about so frequently.
- it was blamed on native women going to war instead of having babies, alcohol, it being "inherent in nature"
- in reality, disease, war, and out-migration. population halved between 1600-1700, and by another third between 1700-1800
- some even proposed to save indigenous amercans by enslaving them ("benevolent curse")
- those that insisted indigenous populations were on the decline (to the objection of those populations), were also convinced that the american west could help save them ("aboriginia").
- deportation would free up the land for white laborers (thomas jefferson)
- john elliott of georgia (1825): the enslavement of african peoples was used to justify that the correct natural order for people of different skin colors was to "unfortunately" be in a dynamic that "subsists together"
- this was seen as "somber" but practical and based on "real life" / the way things just are. this was believed to improve the conditions for both parties, and was used to argue a similar dynamic should be applied for colonizer relationships with the native nations ("mutual dependence")
- disposition and enslavement were acts of humanity.

outcomes

- as they learned more, it became clear the promise of the west wasnt what us colinizers thought it was.
- pivot to instructing native peoples how to "live right"
- teaching english, the bible, give up hunting, start farming, producing clothing, etc. abandon autonomy for us culture
- native peoples knew that without education they could not compete with encroaching colonizing us
- "civilizing plan" was ethnocentric and self-serving and frequently paternalistic and cynical. erasure.
- this plan by most accounts was surprisingly successful (1820s), even segregationists (john calhoun) recognized that it was working to keep indigenous people in their place.
- in order to justify state-sponsored explulsion, this was going to need to be perceived as approaching impending doom, and inevitable catastrophe.
- people were aware of historical perceptions of mass expulsion, and would have to be perceived as a "philanthropic enterprise" that was a matter of "justice and moderation"
- by late 1820s the tide had shifted to one in which mass expulsion felt necessary and practical in dc. how did this happen?

### Chapter 2: The White People of Georgia

"socrates" 1825-1830

- people wrote opinion pieces with greek and roman philosopher names
- "socrates" was one of these wrote an 8000 word essay in a georgian journal
- made the case that "barbarous and savage" native creek nation in alabama's land would be best "rescued from a state of wilderness"
- that this would be "philanthropic and just"
- since "indian title" was considered to be "mere custom" it had no significance
- georgian land was "valuable" and could "grow cotton" georgian senator john elliott
- georgia was seen as an opportunity to assert itself some independence from the north.
- outside florida, georgia was the largest state in the union
- socrates made the case that were natives to be naturalized, then the enslaved would eventually be as well. this was perceived as a threat
- socrates was a racist, interpretting "we the people" explicitly as "we the white people" and made many appeals that that be preserved
- anyone making a case for the rights of these peoples was seen as the north trying to limit the south economically
- "northerners were not motivated by benevolence but jealousy"
- socrates basically threatened war against the north if georgia was not supported in deporting native nations

us govt

- there was a law passed by congress and signed by jefferson at the heart of the successful state-sponsored systematic explusion of indigenous families
- 1830 georgia had lots of land without people to take care of it. taking more land from indigenous people was seen as unnecessary and even bad for the land itself (georgia last of 13 original states to still have significant indigenous population)
- george troup 1820s "mad governer of georgia" joined with princeton classmates john forsyth and john berrien to eliminate native peoples from the eastern half of the us
- troup specifically targeted creek and cherokee nations trying to expel them from georgia
- troup saw georgia land as white mans birthright and that civilizing native peoples as a "great scheme" to keep native peoples on the land
- william mcintosh, part british part creek, was well connected in both worlds but often exploited his creek connections politically. single handedly ceded creek territories and accepted bribes from us commissioners ("treaty of indian springs"). was executed by creek nation april 1825, house surrounded by 150 armed men, set afire and he was shot dead.
- georgia white male voting citizens shared guilt by voting for troup for his achievements in dispossessing the creek nation in georgia
- troup was seen as a defender of "georgian rights" for "native" georgians (white colonizers)
- georgian land was seen as belonging to "native" white georgians.
- 1826 treaty of washington, creeks agreed to have georgian lands ceded, but only if guaranteed their remaining territory.
- choctaws, chickasaws, cherokees, creeks all pushed back against ceding land
- southern politicians sought to devise "other means" by which to expel native nations 1826-27. john mckinley of alabama, thomas buck of mississippi, thomas w cobb of georgia were the subcommittee that developed a strategy central in the national campaign to deport indigenous americans
- it was deemed "extremely improbable" that "negotiation and treaty" would effectively drive native families out of the southern states. needed "lawful and practical means" to accomplish it
- the plan was to extend state laws to indigenous peoples, treating them as members of the states with limited rights, assign them small plots to them. the result being that they will either leave for the. west or be incorporated into colonized body. the latter not really being seen as a possibility.
- that latter possibility was seen as a terrifying thing even if implausible and this was seen as a daring proposition
- this strategy was made largely in secret

logistics of westward expulsion

- water was quicker and cheaper transport at that time
- 60k southern native peoples, 80k total needed migration
- since this would be seen as a "humanitarian undertaking," 15% mortality rate of the middle passage (enslaved peoples) would not be tolerated
- interstate slavetrade model was not seen as viable as it was more like 2k per year, not 60k at one time
- refered to as "migration" instead of what it was "trafficking"

northern perception

- these efforts were largly made fun of by north instead of worked in opposition against
- white southerners called northern critics hypocrites as they had already "exterminated" native peoples
- humanitarian efforts were perceived as "whining charity" and "sentimental trash"
- not all those opposing southern expulsion in the north were the stereotype though. native peoples put forward leaders who argued and made appeals to congress for the protection of the rights of indigenous nations
- the south needed federal aid to actually achieve this expulsion with northern and native resistance
- isaac mccoy had epiphany in 1823 about "aboriginia" and slaveholder andrew jackson became president in 1828. jackson had a history as a general slaughtering native peoples as a southern war hero
- 97 percent of georgia voters voted for jackson.
- december 1829, jackson called for "voluntary" emoigration of native peoples to lands west of the mississippi

### Chapter 3: The Debate

the cherokee phoenix - 1828

- published in northern georgia (chrokee capital new echota)
- many english newspapers (1 per 10k people)
- sequoyah, a chrokee polymath from little tennessee valley invented a written chrokee script
- within a few years of inventing the script, 90% of chrokee nation was literate.
- december 1829 cherokee phoenix published the "memorial of the cherokees" to the us congress
- it asked for pity, sought to dispute the claim that chrokees were "tenants at will" in georgia
- the cherokee and english translations were precisely worded differently per audience, aiming to appeal to both audiences
- roughly 3k out of 18k chrokee signed this petition, most in chrokee syllabary
- chrokee helped creek nation to draft their own
- speaker of the house dismissed both without discussion
- the cherokee memorial was distributed across newspapers and rallied northern sentiments
- this production was seen as a direct challenge to the idea of native nations savagery and subhumanity
- so much so that sequoyah was even said to have caucasian blood in an effort to combat the work
- the cherokee phoeniz defied white southerners who thought all "persons of color" be denied the ability to speak for themselves
- there was a scramble of sorts throughout the 1820s to prevent native nations from speaking for themselves, as well as an effort from native peoples to do so (cherokee scholar david brown)
- by the time the first bill "for the exchange of lands" was introduced into congress in january 1830, native peoples had already cultivated a fervent opposition

jackson, everts, womens petitions

- within weeks of the inauguration, jackson administration started working on principle legislation
- jeremiah everts, converted by native american activists into a native peoples rights activist and writer, wrote 24 essays in late 1829 laying out case against expulsion as argued by native americans all the years prior
- everts followed the lead of indigenous activists, but to a larger audience. was read in at least 40 newspapers and read by a half million people (population of 13 million)
- thanks to this, petitions flooded congress, most formed in evangelical language of the day, were also arguably radical as well
- expulsion was seen as unjust and rarely seen amongst civilized nations
- many womens petition drives came out for the cause, which hadnt been formerly seen. this was used by southern powers as evidence that the north was becoming effeminate, soft, and the gendered criticism was accepted by many in power (men), even in the north.

jackson's early presidency

- inauguration coincided with gold being found in august 1829 which led thousands to min native lands, this led to increased violence in native communities
- expulsion debate started april 6 1830
- lots of back and forth arguing that sounds quite familiar to modern day righteous indignance.
- "to save" native peoples, "they must be expelled."
- counter argument was stronger, that treaties were treaties, regardless of anything else
- the argument was basically "leave, and save yourself"
- expansion of slavery in southern states was also at the root of a lot of this
- under threat from jackson administration as well as vote bargaining, a few house members switched sides and cast votes to expel 102 to 97
- public spirit and outrage was not enough and waned

the "act to provide and exchange of lands with the indians residing in any of the states or territories, and fro their removal west of the river mississippi"

- was poorly put together
- deported families received aid for one year after expulsion
- was explicitly outlined in writing that "this does not violate a treaty"
- no way to tell value of land, no method for negotiation, the logistics of transportation were excluded, no supervision stated
- warnings became threats and by mid 1830s troops were force marching people in chains in alabama and pursuing starving families from camp to camp in florida
- whole thing crumbled and became a nightmare
