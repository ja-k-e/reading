1820-30 Isaac McCoy

- unique individual with self-claimed authority
- felt the call to "save the Indians" in and around Indiana and Michigan.
- claimed Native people were "the very filth of civilized society"
- kept journals of drunken violence and senseless murder from his missionary outpost
- envisioned "Aboriginia" â€” an indigenous nation provided by the United States, a place where indigenous people would be united together, worship God, smoke peace pipes, et al.
- this sort of concept was proposed by many other people around that time (including Thomas Jefferson)
- the thought was that the exchange of lands would protect native peoples until thet were assimilated into the US population
- Andrew Jackson negotiated one of these treaties with the Cherokees in 1817

Native perspective / looming expulsion

- most Native American peoples at this point had been living alongside colonizing white people for serveral generations and believed the way things were was maintainable.
- They were being tol that they could not survive much longer this way and must abandon their lands
- between 1800 and 1830, native people surrendered territory totaling 140k square miles (size of ohio, indiana, and illinois combined) while US population went from 50k to 1.5M
- Northern native peoples had started developing considerably prosperous communities in the northern midwest and did not believe the promised "Indian Territories" offered in exchange for their lands was all it was being cracked up to be.
- Many colonizers recognized how thriving these communities were and even offered that it would be "a cruelty" to expel these communities.
- Many whites did not want them to leave and many nantive peoples wanted to stay and work alongside those people. There was shared community taking place.
- Many US citizens were forced to reckon with this, and had to clear their conciences with these being "laws of nature" rather than "choice"
- There was still a lot of poverty in these areas amongst native communities.
- US southeast also had hesitant nations unwilling to leave, similar story there.
- Bonds were forming between US citizens and native peoples, the only thing irreconcilable was native and white ownership of the same land.

US political reasoning

- the belief was that 1. native peoples were rapidly declining and needed saving, and 2. western territory would provide for these peoples who would die in the east. neither point was well founded.
- this allowed US citizens to feel charitable and righteous about colonizing / dispossessing native peoples.
- decline was seen as "law of nature" to Thomas Jefferson. and "a pity" and a scandal to let it take place. "Imminent extinction" became accepted as fact since it was talked about so frequently.
- it was blamed on native women going to war instead of having babies, alcohol, it being "inherent in nature"
- in reality, disease, war, and out-migration. population halved between 1600-1700, and by another third between 1700-1800
- some even proposed to save indigenous Amercans by enslaving them ("benevolent curse")
- those that insisted indigenous populations were on the decline (to the objection of those populations), were also convinced that the american west could help save them ("Aboriginia").
- Deportation would free up the land for white laborers (Thomas Jefferson)
- John Elliott of Georgia (1825): the enslavement of African peoples was used to justify that the correct natural order for people of different skin colors was to "unfortunately" be in a dynamic that "subsists together"
- This was seen as "somber" but practical and based on "real life" / the way things just are. this was believed to improve the conditions for both parties, and was used to argue a similar dynamic should be applied for colonizer relationships with the native nations ("mutual dependence")
- disposition and enslavement were acts of humanity.

Outcomes

- as they learned more, it became clear the promise of the west wasnt what US colinizers thought it was.
- pivot to instructing native peoples how to "live right"
- teaching english, the bible, give up hunting, start farming, producing clothing, etc. abandon autonomy for US culture
- native peoples knew that without education they could not compete with encroaching colonizing US
- "civilizing plan" was ethnocentric and self-serving and frequently paternalistic and cynical. erasure.
- this plan by most accounts was surprisingly successful (1820s), even segregationists (John Calhoun) recognized that it was working to keep indigenous people in their place.
- in order to justify state-sponsored explulsion, this was going to need to be perceived as approaching impending doom, and inevitable catastrophe.
- people were aware of historical perceptions of mass expulsion, and would have to be perceived as a "philanthropic enterprise" that was a matter of "justice and moderation"
- by late 1820s the tide had shifted to one in which mass expulsion felt necessary and practical in DC. how did this happen?
